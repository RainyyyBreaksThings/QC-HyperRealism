# Questcraft-HyperRealism
A file pack for the Minecraft Java port to Oculus Quest 2


An assortment of mods and texture packs for [QuestCraft](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft). A current list of the mods and texture packs can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/ZJaLvT60).


## Instructions
After you've downloaded the most recent release from the [Releases](https://github.com/RainyyyBreaksThings/QuestCraft-HyperRealism/releases) tab, extract it. Then, just drag and drop the unzipped folder into .minecraft and overwrite anything needed. The .zip includes an options.txt that has been tested to work on Quest 2, modify it at your own discretion.
Don't put the graphics settings too high or the game may slowdown or crash.

Make sure to put the texture packs in the order shown in the [texture pack list](https://pastebin.com/ZJaLvT60).

**Quest 1 is untested, please let us know if it works**
